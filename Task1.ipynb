    "The goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained chemical language model on a regression task using the Lipophilicity dataset. The task involves predicting the lipophilicity value for a given molecule representation (SMILES string). You will learn how to load and tokenize a dataset from HuggingFace, how to load a pre-trained language model, and finally, how to run a model in inference mode.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
