# Fine-Tuning-Chemical-Language-Models-with-LoRA-Influence-Sampling
Fine-tuned MolFormer for lipophilicity prediction using influence-based data selection + parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, BitFit, iA3). LoRA achieved near-full-finetuning performance (R²=0.65) with 98% fewer params. Influence sampling boosted R² from 0.64 → 0.68 — but requires careful tuning. PyTorch + Hugging Face.
